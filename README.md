# farm_hand

Farm Hand gives farmers a simple interface that they can use to enter their daily collection of various eggs. 

They can also enter income from eggs sold and add expenses, and  adjust flock numbers up or down. 

The app makes it easy for a farmer to see all of their various data on one page, and is further color-coded to make scanning through the information easier.
